= Moire Numbers

A demo of an idea I had to display numbers while scrolling. It uses fixed vertical lines to white out certain pixel columns of bg.png which is a 7 segment display number that allows each segment to be turned on and off by blanking out some vertical columns.

It works great on desktop and I included retina resolution images so it works great on retina screens too but on iPad it completely breaks down. The iPad must do some fast but inaccurate compositing while the page is being scrolled so this looks dumb.
